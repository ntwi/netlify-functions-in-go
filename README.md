## File structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ goodbye
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hello
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ internal
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pkg
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ utils
â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ utils.go
â””â”€â”€ netlify.toml
```

### `cmd`

Place your functions. A dir matches to an end-point: `/.netlify/functions/hello`.
Each dir should have `main.go` as `package main`.

### `internal/pkg`

Place your common package for sharing among multiple functions.
In this sample, `utils/utils.go` provides `utils.IntroductionYourself` for `hello`, `goodbye` endpoints.

#### Ensure your environment (prod) provides an environment variable: `GO_IMPORT_PATH`

```
GO_IMPORT_PATH="github.com/[Account]/[Repository name]"
```

### `dashboard`

This dir will be deployed as a website. The root path for your Netlify app brings visitors here.
Put HTML/assets...etc to support your functions ðŸ’ª

## Development

### Build

```
$ make
```

Try to build packages and saves Go binaries into `functions` dir.

### Run tests

```
$ make test
```
